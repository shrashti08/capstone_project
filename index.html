                granted. We must not forget that there are people who need our help to weather these cold months.

                So, why not spread some winter cheer by giving away those clothes that you don’t wear anymore?

                Read the following steps to know how to donate clothes

                The drive was conducted between November 17 and November 22 in collaboration with State Bank of India
                (SBI). All winter clothes were donated via drop boxes put across several colleges and SBI branches in
                Tricity.

                After the sorting and cleaning of collected clothes, the distribution was carried out successfully.
                Members of the NGO visited the inner city neighborhoods early on Wednesday and started with the cloth
                distribution.
                "We had to live up to the trust Tricity residents placed on us by donating their clothes. For that, we
                made sure that their clothes reached the right people," said Rishabh Sardana, city president of "We
                Initiate".

                Aakarshan Mahajan, a volunteer for the NGO, said the credit for the success of the drive went to
                residents of the area. "We are thankful to all the residents of Tricity for donating generously and
                coming out in support of this noble cause."
                Event head for the drive Abhishek Verma added that "We Initiate" planned to make the drive an annual
                affair.
                The drive, which is being organized for the second year, has a team of 70-80 volunteers working for the
                clothes collection campaign. "The NGO has around 500 volunteers registered from Tricity - mostly
                students from Panjab University and various colleges - who work on the mission of 'Awesome India',"
                Sardana added.</p>
